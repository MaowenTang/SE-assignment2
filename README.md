# SE-assignment2

## Project Description
This project is part of the CINS 5318 Software Engineering course.
It demonstrates how to use Git and GitHub for version control, including:
- Creating and cloning a repository
- Working with branches
- Making commits and pushing changes
- Creating and merging pull requests
- Resolving merge conflicts locally
- Managing and closing GitHub Issues

The purpose is to gain hands-on experience with a real-world collaborative development workflow.

## Installation Instructions
Clone this repository and run the program locally.

    git clone https://github.com/MaowenTang/SE-assignment2.git
    cd SE-assignment2
    python --version
    python hello.py

## Usage Examples
Execution

    python hello.py

Expected output:

    Hello, World!
    Hi! Maowen
    Please enter your name: Tang
    Hello, Tang!

## Issues with Resolutions
To demonstrate issue tracking and resolution using GitHub Issues, I created **two issues** in the repository:

- **Issue #1:** Assigned to a classmate.
- **Issue #2:** Assigned to myself — describing the need to add a new feature (`user input` functionality) to the program.

Each issue was tracked through GitHub’s issue management system and linked directly to the corresponding commits using the `Fixes #<issue_number>` syntax. This automatically closed the issues once the commits were pushed to the `main` branch.
